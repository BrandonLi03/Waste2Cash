# Waste2Cash

Waste2Cash is an innovative Kotlin-based application that empowers users to sell their valuable recyclable waste—such as plastic, paper, glass, used oil, and metal—quickly and easily. The platform connects individuals or households looking to sell their recyclable items with verified vendors who are ready to purchase and process these materials for further use.
